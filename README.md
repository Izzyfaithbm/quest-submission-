## Chapter 1 Day 1 

Here are my answers! :)

1. Blockchain is somewhere you can store info, view data, and interact with. The best part is there's no owner! So anyone can do anything (to a certain extent).

2. Smart Contracts are programs that people code to interact with others in the Blockchain. 

3. A transaction changes the data in a smart contract, whereas a script is used to view the contract.

## Chapter 1 Day 2 

My answers! :D

1. Safety/Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming

2. Safety/Security is super useful to the users. Without it, others can hack into it and lots of bad things would happen.
   Clarity is useful to the users because if the person who developed the Smart Contract has bad intentions, it can easily be found within the code. Without clarity, the    code would be too difficult for users (who don't understand Cadence) to read and could possibly agree to a "malicious" contract.
   Approachability is good for developers. People who have coded before and want to learn Cadence will learn with more ease because of it's familiarity.
   Developer Experience is, obviously, useful to developers. It will motivate them to code and help them through confusing errors. 

## Chapter 2 Day 1

MY ANSWERS/CODE :)!

```cadence
pub contract JacobTucker {
  pub let is: String

    init() {
        self.is = "the best"
    }

}
```

## Chapter 2 Day 2

1. A script is only meant to be used to view data in a smart contract, therefore we wouldn't be able to use changeGreeting because only a trasaction can change data.

2. The AuthAccount type acceses the data in your account.

3. The prepare phase acceses info/data on your account, whereas the execute phase changes data on the blockchain.
