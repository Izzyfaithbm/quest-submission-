## Chapter 1 Day 1 

Here are my answers! :)

1. Blockchain is somewhere you can store info, view data, and interact with. The best part is there's no owner! So anyone can do anything (to a certain extent).

2. Smart Contracts are programs that people code to interact with others in the Blockchain. 

3. A transaction is something the user can change, whereas a script is something that the user can only read.
